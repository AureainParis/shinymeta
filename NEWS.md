## News

**2018-08-02 @jcheng5** Thanks for your interest in shinymeta! Please be aware that we have some
upcoming syntax changes planned. In particular, the use of `!!` as an
unquoting operator has presented some insurmountable challenges--thank
you @zappingseb for the feedback. Our current thinking is to use a new
function, `..()`, that will have slightly different semantics at runtime.
See https://github.com/rstudio/shinymeta/pull/59 for our latest thinking.
