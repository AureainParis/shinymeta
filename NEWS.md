# 0.2.0

## Breaking changes

* A different operator, `..()` (instead of `!!`), is now expanded in meta-mode. In normal execution, this operator is not expanded, and is, instead stripped (i.e., `.,(data())` becomes `data()`). See [this wiki page](https://github.com/rstudio/shinymeta/wiki/Syntax-changes-for-shinymeta-0.2.0) for more information.

# 0.1.0 (unreleased)

* Initial version, as presented at useR 2019.
