Here's a reduced version of the [cranview](https://github.com/cpsievert/cranview) Shiny app that allows you to enter an R package name to generate a plot of its [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) downloads over the past year. This app provides a nice example of how to modify an existing Shiny app so that it can generate code to reproduce what a user sees in the app:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("package", "Package name", value = "ggplot2"),
  plotOutput("plot")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  downloads <- reactive({
    # Retrieve a year's worth of daily download data
    cranlogs::cran_downloads(input$package, from = Sys.Date() - 365, to = Sys.Date())
  })
  
  downloads_rolling <- reactive({
    # Show the user an informative message if there are no download counts
    validate(need(sum(downloads()$count) > 0, "Input a valid package name"))
    # Convert daily data to 7 day rolling average
    downloads() %>% mutate(count = zoo::rollapply(count, 7, mean, fill = "extend"))
  })
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(downloads_rolling(), aes(date, count)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Seven day rolling average")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Below is one way the app above could be modified to generate code that reproduces `output$plot` outside of the shiny session. Notice how both the `output$plot` and `output$code` update dynamically in response to new package names without having to repeat any logic of the original app. To keep the focus on code generation, we've presented the `output$code` as simple as possible here (by using `verbatimTextOutput()` and `renderPrint()`), but the [next article](code-distribution.html) outlines the various options distributing code to users.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(shinymeta)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("package", "Package name", value = "ggplot2"),
  verbatimTextOutput("code"),
  plotOutput("plot")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  downloads <- metaReactive({
    "# Retrieve a year's worth of daily download data"
    cranlogs::cran_downloads(!!input$package, from = Sys.Date() - 365, to = Sys.Date())
  })
  
  downloads_rolling <- metaReactive2({
    validate(need(sum(downloads()$count) > 0, "Input a valid package name"))
    
    metaExpr({
      "# Convert daily data to 7 day rolling average"
      !!downloads() %>% mutate(count = zoo::rollapply(count, 7, mean, fill = "extend"))
    })
  })
  
  output$plot <- metaRender(renderPlot, {
      ggplot(!!downloads_rolling(), aes(date, count)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Seven day rolling average")
  })
  
  output$code <- renderPrint({
    expandChain(
      quote(library(ggplot2)), 
      output$plot()
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/T9a60Fm.gif")
```

So, what has changed in the implementation between the original Shiny app and the one that generates code? There a few high-level observations we can make here that should hold true for most apps that leverage **shinymeta** to generate code:

* Each reactive building block (e.g., `reactive()`, `renderPlot()`) has been replaced by a meta variant (e.g., `metaReactive()`, `metaRender()`)
  * This example doesn't have `observe()`, but these [covers their meta variant as well](#observers). 
  * Meta variants have a second version (e.g. `metaReactive2()`) that allows you to completely [ignore Shiny-specific logic](#ignore-code) by wrapping only the code you care about in `metaExpr()`.
* Each read of a meta-reactive or an `input` value has been prepended with `!!`.
* Comments are retained by surrounding them in quotes.
* The output of interest (`output$plot`) is invoked inside `expandChain()`, which generates code to reproduce that output.
    * `expandChain()` also accepts `quote()`d expressions, which allows you to supply any setup code that the user might need (for example, loading libraries).

On the surface, these changes are pretty straight-forward, but for those who really want to understand the details and how it all fits together, we'll have to unpack some fairly sophisticated concepts related to metaprogramming (i.e., writing code that generates code). If you're new to metaprogramming, we recommend reading [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) (especially the [Quasi-quotation chapter](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/quasiquotation.html)), but that shouldn't be necessary to get the gist of what's happening in **shinymeta**.

## Meta execution

Let's start with this particular reactive expression from the original app:

```{r}
downloads <- reactive({
  cranlogs::cran_downloads(input$package, from = Sys.Date() - 365, to = Sys.Date())
})
```

Reactive expressions are great at the job they were designed for: lazy, caching, reactivity-aware calculators of results. However, they don't help in the second part of our goal, which is capturing logic within the app, and making it reusable for others outside of Shiny.

Enter `metaReactive()`. Let's do nothing besides change `reactive()` to `metaReactive()`:

```{r}
downloads <- metaReactive({
  cranlogs::cran_downloads(input$package, from = Sys.Date() - 365, to = Sys.Date())
})
```

By default, the behavior of `downloads()` doesn't change at all: it still evaluates and caches results just like a normal `reactive()` does:

```{r}
downloads()
```

However, `metaReactive()`s have the added ability to return code expressions when invoked in "meta mode". **shinymeta** currently provides two ways to invoke reactives in meta mode: `withMetaMode()` and `expandChain()`. In practice, you'll almost always want to use `expandChain()` over `withMetaMode()`: it has the added ability of assigning return values to a name and reusing that name when necessary, which helpful for avoiding redundant code and computation when [chaining reactives](#chaining).

```{r}
expandChain(downloads())
```

Notice how the generated code here depends on the input variable `input$package`. If we were to run this code in a new R session, it would error because `input$package` isn't defined outside of the shiny session. We can, however, replace the literal name "`input$package`" with the value it represents (by unquoting it with `!!`), which allows the code to run a context where `input` isn't defined. 

## Unquoting with `!!` {#unquoting}

In computing, functions that return code expressions (e.g., `metaReactive()`) are called quoting functions. Since **shinymeta** supports [tidy evaluation](https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/), quoting functions are also quasi-quoting functions, meaning they allow you to selectively evaluate (i.e., unquote or expand) parts of a quoted expression. For a simple example, consider the `expr()` function from the **rlang** package which allow you to create code expressions:

```{r}
library(rlang)

a <- 2
expr(a + 1)
```

One way to produce an equivalent code expression that doesn't depend on the object `a` existing would be to use the `!!` operator to unquote (aka, evaluate or expand) the symbol `a`, which replaces it with the value it represents:

```{r}
expr(!!a + 1)
```

The idea is essentially the same when we wish to insert the value of `input$package` into the code (rather than the literal name "`input$package`"). In other words, to remove the dependency on objects that only exist in the shiny runtime in your generated code, you need to unquote input value (i.e., `input$xxx`) or reactive value (i.e. `reactiveVal()`) inside any meta-reactive expression:

```{r}
downloads <- metaReactive({
  cranlogs::cran_downloads(!!input$package, from = Sys.Date() - 365, to = Sys.Date())
})
expandChain(downloads())
```

Depending on the ultimate purpose of the script we generate, we may or may not also want to replace a `Sys.Date()` call (which returns the current date) the actual value (at run time). For example, we produce code that acquires downloads starting `from` a year prior to the date the code _was generated_ and `to` whenever the code is _actually run_. The former requires us to un-quote `Sys.Date()` whereas the latter doesn't.

```{r}
# Ask yourself: what's the difference between `rlang::expr(!!Sys.Date() - 365)` and `rlang::expr(!!(Sys.Date() - 365))`?
# Why is that difference important in this case?
downloads <- metaReactive({
  cranlogs::cran_downloads(!!input$package, from = !!(Sys.Date() - 365), to = Sys.Date())
})
expandChain(downloads())
```

Whoa, what's this `structure()` business? Well, it's an unfortunate consequence of deparsing values that contain attributes (e.g., `deparse(Sys.Date())`), and deparsing is necessary for [supporting comments](#comments) and formatting code. In this case, since the `from` argument accepts string in `"yyyy-mm-dd"` format (i.e., the `Date` class isn't necessary), we can use `format()` to coerce the `Date` object into a string (and thus, more human-readable).

```{r}
downloads <- metaReactive({
  cranlogs::cran_downloads(!!input$package, from = !!format(Sys.Date() - 365), to = Sys.Date())
})
expandChain(downloads())
```

> #### Takeaway: unquote reactive inputs/values (e.g., `!!input$package`)

In summary, unquoting replaces a name with the value that it represents; and thus, is a essential tool for generating code that can run outside of a shiny session. That's because, in a shiny app, we often refer to reactive values that are only defined inside a shiny runtime. Unquoting is fairly straightforward when the name you're unquoting (`e.g. input$package`) represents a constant value (e.g. `"ggplot2"`), but become more complicated when those values become more complicated. In the next section, we'll be chaining meta-reactive expressions, which requires unquoting names that represent meta-reactives. That means, these names can actually represent un-evaluated expressions!

## Chaining meta-reactives {#chaining}

Chaining of reactive expressions is a very useful pattern that allows Shiny to intelligently cache computations for you. Note that our example app has a reactive chain: the acquistion of daily downloads is done in one reactive expression, `downloads()`, then `downloads_rolling()` uses the return value of `downloads()` to compute a weekly rolling average. For now, let's imagine `download_rolling()` is implemented this way (in the next section, we'll cover actual implementation):

```{r}
downloads_rolling <- metaReactive({
  downloads() %>% mutate(count = zoo::rollapply(count, 7, mean, fill = "extend"))
})
```

Recall that, when invoked with meta-mode enabled, `metaReactive()`, like `rlang::expr()`, quotes its input, which is why `downloads()` appears in the code produced by `downloads_rolling()`:

```{r}
expandChain(downloads_rolling())
```

So, similar to the problem we had before with `input$package`, the generated code relies on something that won't be defined in a new R session (`downloads()`). However, by unquoting `downloads()`, we can replace it with the value it represents: a code expression (when invoked in meta mode)!

```{r}
downloads_rolling <- metaReactive({
  !!downloads() %>% mutate(count = zoo::rollapply(count, 7, mean, fill = "extend"))
})
expandChain(downloads_rolling())
```

> #### Takeaway: unquote meta-reactive reads (i.e., `!!downloads()`) that appear within other meta-reactives


## Ignoring Shiny logic {#ignore-code}

Recall that the actual implementation of `downloads_rolling()` uses Shiny's input validation helpers (e.g. `validate()`, `need()`, and `req()`) to relay an informative message to the user if they've input a package name that doesn't exist on CRAN:

```{r}
downloads_rolling <- reactive({
  validate(need(sum(downloads()$count) > 0, "Input a valid package name"))
  downloads() %>% mutate(count = zoo::rollapply(count, 7, mean, fill = "extend"))
})
```

Input validation is helpful for your shiny app, but it probably just adds unnecessary complexity to your generated code. For this reason, **shinymeta** provides a second version of each meta-reactive (e.g., `metaReactive2()`, `metaObserve2()`, `metaRender2()`, etc), which allows you to capture only the code you care about with `metaExpr()`. Inside these `-2` variants, only the meta-reactive reads inside `metaExpr()` undergo meta execution. In other words, in the example below, the read of `downloads()` that appears before `metaExpr()` *always* returns it's a data frame (the `validate()` wouldn't make sense if `downloads()` returned code!). 

```{r}
downloads_rolling <- metaReactive2({
  validate(need(sum(downloads()$count) > 0, "Input a valid package name"))
  
  metaExpr({
    !!downloads() %>% mutate(count = zoo::rollapply(count, 7, mean, fill = "extend"))
  })
})

expandChain(downloads_rolling())
```

When using these `-2` variants, make sure the return value of the expression is a `metaExpr()` object (In practice, the code you want to capture might depend on other input value(s). In that case, you can use control flow [similar to this](https://github.com/cpsievert/cranview/blob/f4989a9/app.R#L71-L89), just make sure to return a `metaExpr()`!).

## Other meta-reactives (observers & outputs) {#observers}

So far we've learned how to manage reactive values (e.g., `input$package`) and reactive expressions (e.g., `downloads()`), but what about code captured in the endpoints of shiny's reactivity model (i.e. observers and outputs)?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("reactivity-graph-00.png")
```

#### Observers

Creating a meta variant of `observe()` is very similar to creating a meta variant of `reactive()`: use `metaObserve()` instead of `observe()` and unquote any references to reactive values or expressions. Note that, outside of meta mode, `metaObserve()` behaves the same as `observe()`: it immediately evaluates the given expression (i.e., there's no need to invoke `msgObs()` outside of meta mode).

```{r}
msgObs <- metaObserve({
  message(!!input$package, " has an daily download average of ", mean((!!downloads())$count))
})
expandChain(msgObs())
```

The traditional `observe()` function returns an object that can be used to control aspects of the observer, though most Shiny apps don't bother to save it. See `?observe` for the different methods available. The object returned from `metaObserve()` can be used in the same way (`msgObs$suspend()`, for example) but has the additional capability of being called like a function, as in the previous code example.

#### Outputs

Since package authors are allowed to create their own output rendering functions, creating a meta variant of an output renderer (e.g. `renderPlot()`) needs to be more general than prefixing `meta` to the function name (as we did with `metaReactive()` and `metaObserve()`). Therefore, **shinymeta** has a general-purpose `metaRender()` function that anticipates a rendering function in it's first argument, and an expression in the second argument.^[`metaRender()` makes some assumptions about the arguments taken by the render function, assumptions that we believe are true for all existing render functions. If you encounter a render function that doesn't seem to work properly with **shinymeta**, please let us know by [filing an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/shinymeta/issues).] Here's how we can make a meta variant of the CRAN downloads plot:

```{r}
output$plot <- metaRender(renderPlot, {
  ggplot(!!downloads_rolling(), aes(date, count)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Seven day rolling average")
})
```

Similar to `metaReactive()` and `metaObserve()`, invoking an output inside `expandChain()` generates the code required to reproduce it.^[If meta mode is not enabled, `output$OUTPUT_ID()` will intentionally produce an error.]

```{r}
expandChain(output$plot())
```

## Controlling code generation {#code-expansion}

So far we've seen relatively simple use of `expandChain()`: give it any meta-reactive and it returns the code that the meta-reactive depends on. Often times, though, that code captured inside meta-reactives isn't 100% sufficient for reproducing a code result. For example, in order for the code generated by `expandChain(output$plot())` to run in a fresh R session, you'd need to first load **ggplot2**. For this, and other reasons, `expandChain()` allows you to pass in `quote()`d expressions:

```{r}
expandChain(
  quote(library(ggplot2)),
  output$plot()
)
```

You can also give `expandChain()` multiple meta-reactives and it will know not to duplicate the code that they depend on:

```{r}
# add another output just to demonstrate
output$summary <- metaRender(renderPrint, {
  summary((!!downloads())$count)
})

expandChain(
  quote(library(ggplot2)),
  output$plot(),
  output$summary()
)
```

Note, however, that if we expand these outputs separately, `expandChain()` won't know to avoid duplicating code for dependencies that they share. In our case, both of these outputs depend on `downloads`, so if we expand them in subsequent calls to `expandChain()`, we'll be producing code that calls `cranlogs::cran_downloads()` twice:

```{r}
expandChain(output$plot())
```

```{r}
expandChain(output$summary())
```

Fortunately, there is a way to avoid this redundant code caused by shared dependencies by sharing an 'expansion context' between subsequent calls to `expandChain()`. This is especially useful for [generating reports](#generating-reports):

```{r}
ec <- newExpansionContext()
expandChain(output$plot(), .expansionContext = ec)
```

```{r}
expandChain(output$summary(), .expansionContext = ec)
```

Expansion contexts are also useful for cases where you need to redefine a meta-reactive's logic. This is useful in at least two scenarios:

1. For efficiency or privacy reasons, you may not want to provide the "rawest" form of the data in your app to users. Instead, you might want to only provide a transformed and/or summarized version of the data. For example, instead of providing the user with `downloads`, we could provide `downloads_rolling` as file to be [included as part of a download bundle](code-distribution.html#including-other-files).

```{r}
saveRDS(downloads_rolling(), "d.rds")
ec <- newExpansionContext()
ec$substituteMetaReactive(downloads_rolling, function() {
  metaExpr(readRDS("d.rds"))
})

expandChain(
  quote(library(ggplot2)),
  output$plot(),
  .expansionContext = ec
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
unlink("d.rds")
```

2. Apps that allow users to upload a file: the location of the file on the server won't be available to users, so it may be easier just to substitute the reactive that reads the uploaded file. For an example, see [this example](code-distribution.html#including-other-files) in the next vignette.
